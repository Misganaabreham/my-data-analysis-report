## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to maximize the number of annual memberships for Cyclistic by understanding the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. This report provides data-driven insights to help design a marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to convert into annual members.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis includes historical trip data from Cyclistic. These datasets are public data provided by Motivate International Inc. under a specific license. The data includes trip start and end times, trip duration, bike IDs, and user types (casual or member).

## Tools Used
- **R**: Used in all stages of the analysis, including data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
In the data preparation phase, the following steps were taken using R:

1. **Remove Duplicate Records**: Ensured that each ride is unique.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Cleaned up the data by addressing null values in critical columns.
3. **Standardize Data Formats**: Ensured consistency in date and time formats.
4. **Correct Data Types**: Converted columns to their appropriate data types (e.g., dates, integers).
5. **Remove Outliers**: Identified and removed outliers to enhance the reliability of the analysis.
6. **Verify Data Consistency**: Checked the data for logical consistency across columns.

### Defining the Problem
The following questions guide the marketing strategy for converting casual riders to annual members:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The main question to be answered in this analysis is: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Data Analysis
The analysis focused on several key metrics using R:

### Count of Rides by Member Type
```r
ride_count <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n())
Average Duration of Rides by Member Type
r
Copy code
avg_duration <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarize(avg_duration = mean(ride_length))
Most Popular Bike Type by Member Type
r
Copy code
popular_bike_type <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(ride_count))
Ride Frequency by Day of the Week
r
Copy code
ride_frequency <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n())
Ride Duration by Time of Day
r
Copy code
ride_duration_by_hour <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  mutate(hour_of_day = hour(started_at)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, hour_of_day) %>%
  summarize(avg_duration = mean(ride_length))
Results & Findings
The analysis revealed several key insights:

Annual Members: Use the bikes more frequently and for longer durations, indicating reliance on bikes for commuting or daily use.
Casual Riders: Tend to ride more on weekends and show variability in bike type preferences.
Usage Patterns: Annual membersâ€™ ride patterns align with traditional commuting hours, whereas casual riders use bikes more sporadically throughout the day.
Station Popularity: Certain stations are more popular among casual riders, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns:

For Casual Riders: Promote weekday bike usage through targeted ads and incentives to encourage more frequent use.
For Annual Members: Offer additional perks or rewards to enhance loyalty and maintain high usage rates.
Service Enhancements:

Bike Availability: Ensure popular bike types are available in high-demand areas and during peak times.
Station Placement: Optimize station locations to accommodate higher weekend and holiday usage by casual riders.
Operational Adjustments:

Maintenance Schedule: Align maintenance schedules with peak usage times to minimize downtime.
User Engagement: Regularly collect feedback from both user groups to improve services and address any issues.
Limitations
This analysis had the following limitations:

Data Cleaning: Cleaning rows with null entries reduced the sample size, potentially impacting the robustness of the findings.
Outliers: Some outliers remained, which could influence the results but were not entirely removable without compromising data integrity.
Conclusion
This README outlines the objectives, data sources, tools, methods, results, and recommendations of the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis. It provides a clear path from data collection to actionable insights, offering a foundation for marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders to annual members.
