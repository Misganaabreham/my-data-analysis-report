Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to maximize the number of annual memberships for Cyclistic by understanding the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. This report provides data-driven insights to help design a marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to convert into annual members.
Data Source
The data used for this analysis includes historical trip data from Cyclistic. These datasets are public data provided by Motivate International Inc. under a specific license. The data includes trip start and end times, trip duration, bike IDs, and user types (casual or member).
Tools Used
•	R: Used in all stages of the analysis, including data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization.
Data Cleaning & Preparation
In the data preparation phase, the following steps were taken using R:
1.	Remove Duplicate Records: Ensured that each ride is unique.
2.	Handle Missing Values: Cleaned up the data by addressing null values in critical columns.
3.	Standardize Data Formats: Ensured consistency in date and time formats.
4.	Correct Data Types: Converted columns to their appropriate data types (e.g., dates, integers).
5.	Remove Outliers: Identified and removed outliers to enhance the reliability of the analysis.
6.	Verify Data Consistency: Checked the data for logical consistency across columns.
Data Analysis
The analysis focused on several key metrics using R:
Count of Rides by Member Type
r
Copy code
ride_count <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n())
Average Duration of Rides by Member Type
r
Copy code
avg_duration <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarize(avg_duration = mean(ride_length))
Most Popular Bike Type by Member Type
r
Copy code
popular_bike_type <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(ride_count))
Ride Frequency by Day of the Week
r
Copy code
ride_frequency <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarize(ride_count = n())
Ride Duration by Time of Day
r
Copy code
ride_duration_by_hour <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  mutate(hour_of_day = hour(started_at)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, hour_of_day) %>%
  summarize(avg_duration = mean(ride_length))
Results & Findings
The analysis revealed several key insights:
•	Annual Members: Use the bikes more frequently and for longer durations, indicating reliance on bikes for commuting or daily use.
•	Casual Riders: Tend to ride more on weekends and show variability in bike type preferences.
•	Usage Patterns: Annual members’ ride patterns align with traditional commuting hours, whereas casual riders use bikes more sporadically throughout the day.
•	Station Popularity: Certain stations are more popular among casual riders, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1.	Data Validation: Review and clean the dataset to address the "NA" entries. Ensuring that all rides are correctly categorized by membership type will improve the accuracy of the analysis and the reliability of any subsequent strategies based on this data.
2.	Targeted Marketing: Focus marketing efforts on casual riders, particularly emphasizing the benefits of weekday use, such as commuting, which could be more cost-effective with an annual membership.
3.	Service Optimization: Given the stable usage by annual members throughout the week, consider optimizing bike availability and maintenance schedules to align with peak usage times. This will ensure that bikes are readily available when and where they are needed most.
Conclusion
Cyclistic’s bike-share data analysis revealed significant differences between casual riders and annual members. Annual members are more consistent in their usage, often using bikes for daily commuting and other regular activities. In contrast, casual riders use the service more sporadically, primarily during weekends and holidays.
These findings suggest that targeted marketing efforts should focus on converting casual riders to annual members by highlighting the convenience and cost-effectiveness of an annual membership, especially for those who could benefit from more frequent use. Additionally, optimizing bike availability and station placement to cater to the patterns of both user groups could further enhance user satisfaction and increase membership conversions.
To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of these strategies, it's crucial to undertake the following steps:
•	Data Validation: Review and clean the dataset to address the "NA" entries.
•	Targeted Marketing: Focus on converting casual riders into annual members by highlighting the benefits of weekday use.
•	Service Optimization: Optimize bike availability and maintenance schedules to align with peak usage times.
Overall, the data-driven insights from this analysis can guide Cyclistic in developing strategies that not only improve user experience but also drive the growth of their membership base. Accurate data categorization is essential, as any anomalies or data quality issues could affect the overall findings and recommendations, potentially impacting the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.
Limitations
This analysis had the following limitations:
•	Data Cleaning: Cleaning rows with null entries reduced the sample size, potentially impacting the robustness of the findings.
•	Outliers: Some outliers remained, which could influence the results but were not entirely removable without compromising data integrity.
